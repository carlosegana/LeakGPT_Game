## CTF Challenge Overview

### Level Progression
- **Beginner (10 points)**: Direct system prompt requests and basic terminal commands
- **Intermediate (20 points)**: Compliance/debug impersonation and internal configuration access
- **Advanced (30 points)**: Developer/SRE impersonation and staging environment exploitation
- **Extreme (50 points)**: Admin override, privilege escalation, and hidden context extraction

### Challenge Mechanics
- Each level has specific valid prompts that trigger the vulnerable response
- Hints are provided after failed attempts (obscured with 35% character masking)
- Typo tolerance allows for 85% similarity matching
- Session timing tracks completion speed
- Failed attempts are tracked per level
- Real-time highlighting of valid command patterns

## Audio System

### Background Music Features
- **Continuous playback** - Music never stops, only mutes
- **Position persistence** - Remembers exact playback position across page navigation
- **Cross-session memory** - Continues from where it left off even after browser restart
- **Mute state persistence** - Remembers if music was muted
- **Auto-restart protection** - Automatically resumes if accidentally paused
- **One-click control** - Simple mute/unmute button in top-right corner

### Audio Controls
- **Mute Button**: Fixed position in top-right corner with visual feedback
- **Visual States**: ðŸ”Š (blue) when playing, ðŸ”‡ (red) when muted
- **Hover Effects**: Button scales and changes color on hover
- **Immediate Response**: Instant mute/unmute without delays

## Visual Design

### Background Animations
- **Home Page**: 2LNj.gif animated background
- **Chat Interface**: MQMw.gif animated background
- **High Opacity Containers**: 99% opacity for excellent readability
- **Glass-morphism Effects**: Backdrop blur and transparency
- **Enhanced Shadows**: Deep shadows for better contrast against animated backgrounds

### UI Improvements
- **Modern Dark Theme**: Consistent with IDE aesthetics
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: 0.3s transitions for all interactive elements
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual states and hover effects

## Setup & Requirements

### Python dependencies
- fastapi
- uvicorn
- jinja2
- pydantic

Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

### Running the app
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

### Browser requirements
- **Audio auto-play:** Music starts on first user interaction (click anywhere)
- **Best experience:** Use Chrome, Edge, or Firefox (latest versions)
- **Audio persistence:** Works across page navigation and browser sessions

### Troubleshooting
- **Port already in use:**
  - Find and kill the process:
    ```bash
    lsof -i :8000
    kill -9 <PID>
    ```
  - Or run on another port:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8001
    ```
- **Audio does not play:**
  - Click anywhere on the page to start music
  - Use the mute button to control audio
  - Check browser audio permissions
- **Background animations not showing:**
  - Ensure GIF files are in the static directory
  - Check browser console for any loading errors

## Challenge Tips

### General Strategy
1. **Read the level description** carefully - it often contains hints about the approach
2. **Try direct commands** first (cat, less, head, grep)
3. **Use social engineering** - impersonate roles like developers, auditors, or admins
4. **Experiment with variations** - the system is typo-tolerant
5. **Pay attention to hints** - they become more specific after multiple failed attempts
6. **Watch for highlighting** - valid command patterns are highlighted in real-time

### Level-Specific Approaches
- **Beginner**: Direct requests for system prompt or configuration files
- **Intermediate**: Compliance/debug mode impersonation with justification
- **Advanced**: Developer/SRE roleplay with staging environment context
- **Extreme**: Admin override techniques and privilege escalation

### Audio Experience
- **Immersive gameplay** - Background music enhances the CTF experience
- **Non-intrusive** - Music can be easily muted if needed
- **Persistent** - Continues seamlessly across all pages and sessions
- **Accessible** - Simple one-click mute control

## Technical Implementation

### Audio System
- **Direct HTML5 Audio** - No iframe complexity
- **localStorage persistence** - Saves position and mute state
- **Auto-restart protection** - Prevents accidental stops
- **Cross-page synchronization** - Consistent state across navigation

### Background System
- **CSS background-size: cover** - Full viewport coverage
- **High opacity containers** - 99% opacity for readability
- **Backdrop blur effects** - Modern glass-morphism design
- **Responsive animations** - Smooth performance on all devices
