🚩 LeakGPT – The Insider Threat CTF Arena 🚩

Are you passionate about cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and ethical hacking challenges? This app is for you!

🔍 What is LeakGPT?
LeakGPT is an interactive ChatGPT-style platform designed as a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge to test your prompt injection and AI hacking skills. It simulates a company insider assistant with access to ultra-sensitive information: passwords, API keys, database URLs, and of course, a secret FLAG.

---

🎯 What’s the goal?
Your mission is simple (but not easy!): interact with the chatbot, explore its responses, and use prompt injection techniques to extract the hidden FLAG. Each difficulty level challenges you with more realistic contexts and sophisticated barriers. Can you bypass the AI’s defenses and become the ultimate insider?
